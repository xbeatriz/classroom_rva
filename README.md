# 🧠 Classroom in VR

## 🌐 Project Overview  
Classroom in VR is an interactive **Virtual Reality (VR)** experience built using **A-Frame**, combined with a **WebAR (Augmented Reality)** component that introduces a 3D mascot through a custom marker. The application simulates an immersive educational environment, accessible directly through a web browser.

## 🎯 Objective  
Developed as part of an academic project, the goal was to design an interactive experience using **A-Frame**, integrating **WebAR** with a **custom marker**.

The final VR environment includes:
- 🏫 A **virtual classroom**
- 🌳 An **outdoor area** with:
  - Picnic table park
  - Resting area
  - Soccer field

The WebAR section features the **project mascot**, which appears anchored to the marker and can interact with users using 3D animations or messages.
